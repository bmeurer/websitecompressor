  <comment>WebsiteCompressor is a small, fast and very easy to use Java utility that minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML files by removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in size and load faster. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
