WebsiteCompressor is a small, fast and very easy to use Java utility that
minifies a whole website, with all CSS, HTML, JavaScript and XML files by
removing extra whitespaces, comments and other unneeded characters without
breaking the content structure. As a result the pages become smaller in
size and load faster.
